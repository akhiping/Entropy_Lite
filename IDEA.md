## Summary

BranchGPT is a Chrome extension and user interface concept designed to enhance the traditional linear ChatGPT experience by allowing users to:

- Open **mini-conversations (branches)** attached to any response element (text highlight or position).
- "Entertain" side queries without derailing the main conversational thread.
- Name, color, and categorize these branches for creative, exploratory, or analytical work.
- Persist and recall these micro-conversations at will.

This idea turns ChatGPT into a **structured ideation environment**, enabling dynamic, non-linear exploration of thoughts, much like working in Roam Research, Figma stickies, or a multidimensional mind map — but powered by LLMs.

## Key Features

- **Branch Portals:** Inline clickable mini-chat bubbles anchored to text or scroll points.
- **Threaded GPT Interaction:** Each branch retains its own message history and prompt lineage.
- **Color-coded + Named Branches:** Users can distinguish "Idea", "Clarification", "Rebuttal", etc.
- **Anchor-Based Navigation:** Dotted lines or visual indicators connect branches to their source.
- **Persistent and Recallable:** Stored locally (or synced), with full state recovery.
- **Export & Versioning:** Allows exporting of entire sessions, branches, or summaries.
