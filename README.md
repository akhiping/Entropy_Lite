# Entropy Lite – Branching Conversations for ChatGPT

> "Linear conversation is for machines. **Exploration** is for minds."

## 🟣 Overview

**Entropy Lite** reimagines how we interact with AI. Created by **Akhila Pingali**, this tool transforms ChatGPT's linear chat format into a **dynamic, branching conversation environment** where you can explore side thoughts and questions without losing your main thread.

Through intuitive visual anchors and floating chat portals, Entropy Lite lets you **pause any moment**, **branch off an idea**, and **explore new directions** while keeping your original conversation intact.

---

## 🌱 Why Entropy Lite?

Traditional AI chat tools are powerful but follow a **linear format**. This becomes limiting when you're:

- Brainstorming and want to follow multiple idea threads
- Researching and need to clarify concepts without losing your place
- Writing and want to explore alternate directions
- Problem-solving and considering multiple approaches

**Real thinking is messy, non-linear, and layered.** Ideas overlap, questions emerge mid-flow, and tangents often lead to breakthroughs. Entropy Lite honors this natural flow of thought — providing structure without restriction.

---

## ✨ What Entropy Lite Enables

### 🧩 Branching Conversations

At any point in a ChatGPT response, you can click to open a **mini chat portal**. This creates a **branch** — a dedicated space where side ideas or clarifications can be explored without interrupting your main conversation.

### 🧠 Smart Side Notes

Each branch acts like a living sticky note powered by GPT. It captures questions, insights, and iterations right where the idea occurred, maintaining visual connection to the original context.

### 🏷️ Organized Exploration

Assign **labels** and **colors** to distinguish different types of branches (clarifications, alternatives, definitions, etc.). Transform scattered thoughts into a structured canvas of reasoning.

### 🔁 Persistent Memory

All branches are saved and reopenable. Return to any moment, recall side threads, and continue building upon them whenever you're ready.

## 🎯 Who Is Entropy Lite For?

Perfect for anyone who uses AI as a creative or intellectual partner:

- **Researchers** exploring hypotheses and side questions
- **Writers** developing plots and exploring alternatives
- **Developers** troubleshooting and comparing solutions
- **Students** asking clarifying questions mid-study
- **Anyone** who thinks *"I want to explore this... but not lose my main thread"*

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. Have a normal conversation with ChatGPT
2. At any point, **select text or click a position** and hit the "💬 branch" button
3. A **mini GPT chat window** opens for your side question or tangent
4. The AI responds, and your branch conversation begins
5. **Name and color** your branch for easy reference
6. All branches stay accessible — expand, collapse, or revisit anytime
7. Your main conversation continues uninterrupted

---

## 🌿 The Philosophy

The name *Entropy* represents the organic disorder of thought — the creative chaos that happens when you're truly exploring ideas. But Entropy Lite doesn't stop at chaos; it adds **thoughtful organization** to capture and structure that organic thinking.

Entropy Lite allows you to:
- Embrace tangents without losing focus
- Capture ideas in the moment
- Build layered understanding
- Think the way minds actually work

It's **thought scaffolding** for the AI age.

## 🚀 Technical Notes

**What You Need:**
- Chrome browser
- Your own OpenAI API key
- ChatGPT access

**How It Works:**
- Entropy Lite operates as a browser extension overlay
- Branches are separate API calls to maintain isolation
- All data stored locally for privacy
- Each branch conversation is independent

---

## 🔐 Privacy & Control

- **Your data stays with you** — all conversations stored locally
- **Your API key** — you control your OpenAI usage and costs
- **No external servers** — everything runs in your browser

---

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

- Chrome browser only (for now)
- Requires personal OpenAI API key
- Branch conversations don't share memory with main thread
- UI may need updates if ChatGPT changes their interface
- Each branch uses API tokens (your usage, your cost)

---

## 🧭 The Vision

Entropy Lite is the first step toward a new paradigm of AI interaction — where conversations grow like trees, not trains on tracks. Created by **Akhila Pingali**, it paves the way for:

- Visual knowledge networks
- Non-linear creative exploration  
- Context-preserved ideation
- AI as a true thinking partner
